## Description
My project is a camping-themed game of tic-tac-toe! Two users can play against one another and the application will keep track of their wins.

## Technology Used
- JavaScript

- HTML

- CSS

## Features

- The game will track possible winning and draw conditions and alert players when one has won or when a draw has been reached.
- After a win or draw the board will automatically reset after a period of time.
- The win counter for each side will track the number of wins each player has.
- The game is responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile allowing users to play on the go (or while out camping)!

## To Use

### Play some tic-tac-toe!
Begin by selecing which player will be player 1 (the tent) and which will be player 2 (the pine tree) -- player 1 will start the game off by selecting a square to place their token and so on and so forth! After each win or draw, the opposite player begins the next game.

### Play via mobile!
The site is fully responsive across desktop, tablet and mobile so you can play on the go.

## Future Additions
- Add local storage so users are able to see their win counter persist on refresh
- Add a landing page where players can select their own tokens before playing and can enter in their names
